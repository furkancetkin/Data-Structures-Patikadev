# Insertion Sort Steps
## Steps of insertion sort algorithm for the given array
### Array1 = [22,27,16,2,18,6];

### Steps :
- [2 | 27, 16, 22, 18, 6] => 2 <-> 22
- [2, 6 | 16, 22, 18, 27] => 6 <-> 27
- [2, 6, 16 | 22, 18, 27] => none
- [2, 6, 16, 18 | 22, 27] => 18 <-> 22
- [2, 6, 16, 18, 22 | 27] => none

### Big O Notation : *O(n^2)*

- [2 | 27, 16, 22, 18, 6] => n
- [2, 6 | 16, 22, 18, 27] => n - 1
- [2, 6, 16 | 22, 18, 27] => n - 2
- [2, 6, 16, 18 | 22, 27] => n - 3
- [2, 6, 16, 18, 22 | 27] => 1

### 18 is avarage case because it is in the middle of the array

### Array2 = [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6];
- [2 | 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6] => 2 <-> 7
- [2, 3 | 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6] => none
- [2, 3, 4 | 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6] => 4 <-> 5
- [2, 3, 4, 6 | 7, 9, 5, 15, 8] => 6 <-> 8
